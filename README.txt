1. Create a favicon.ico file (16x16, 32x32, or 48x48 pixels) and place it in the root directory
2. The favicon should be in .ico format
3. You can use online favicon generators to create one from an image

Note: The favicon.ico file should be placed in the root directory of the project, not in this folder.
This folder is for additional icons that might be used in the application.
